"""Trade Manager — pre-trade gate with pluggable filters.

Currently implements the 'Diff Side from N-2' filter:
  - Only take a trade if the current signal side DIFFERS from the side
    traded at slot N-2 (two slots ago).
  - If N-2 had no trade (skipped, filtered, or bot was offline), the
    filter passes (we allow the trade — no data = no block).
  - Toggle stored in DB settings key 'n2_filter_enabled' (default: true).
  - When is_demo=True the filter checks demo trade history (is_demo=1)
    instead of real trade history (is_demo=0).

Calling convention:
    result = await TradeManager.check(signal_side, current_slot_ts)
    if result.allowed:
        # proceed with trade
    else:
        # log result.reason, record block in DB, notify Telegram
